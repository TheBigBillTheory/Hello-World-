# Hello-World-
Funny, I remember doing this in high-school forever and a day ago in C+ class.  Yes I said C+ and high school.  I wish I had discovered this sooner.  It's fun and though it's taking a good bit of time to learn.  And I'm older then most...I'm hoping this is something in the near future that I'll make my career.
